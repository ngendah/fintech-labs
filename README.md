- State management and secrets handling

### 2. LLM Financial Assistant

**Folder**: [financial-assistant](./financial-assistant/)

- LLM agents for financial insight generation
- RESTful API built with FastAPI
- Query UI built with Next.js
- Dockerized deployment

### 3. Automated Savings Service

**Folder**: [savings-automaton](./savings-automaton/)

- Backend logic to simulate recurring savings schedules
- RESTful API in Node.js (NestJS + Prisma) with PostgreSQL
- Integration with Equity Bank (Kenya) and USSD STK trigger
- Dockerized and Kubernetes-ready

### 4. Modular Payments Wallet Microservices

**Folder**: [modular-payments-wallet](./modular-payments-wallet/)

- Microservices architecture in Node.js (NestJS)
- Services include Fraud Detection, KYC, and Notifications
- Simulated API calls to trigger inter-service communication
- Dockerized and Kubernetes-ready

### 5. Fraud Detection Data Pipeline

**Folder**: [fraud-detection](./fraud-detection/)

- Python-based Prefect pipeline for data extraction and fraud model training  
- Uses Kaggle dataset and scikit-learn for fraud detection  
- Dockerized for deployment and reproducibility

### 6. Monitoring & Alerts for Cloud Apps

**Folder**: [ops-monitoring](./ops-monitoring/)

- Real-time dashboards for service health monitoring
- Custom alerts for latency, CPU usage, and payment failures
- Simulated logs and fake payment traffic via script
